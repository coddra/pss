# pass
`pass` is a simple password manager in python, that uses the clipboard to manage your passwords.

**No passwords are stored as-is** on your computer, but they are hashed by a master key, given by you. The master key is not stored anywhere and is impossible to retrieve.

## installation

Run the following commands to install `pass`:

```
git clone https://github/coddra/pass
cd ./pass
./install.sh
```

Running `pass` for the first time will guide you through the setup.
